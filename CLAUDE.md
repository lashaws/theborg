# The Borg

The Borg is a standardized AI workspace that turns prompts, institutional knowledge, tools, and repeatable workflows into an AI operating environment.

## Directory Structure

- `cerebruh/` — shared knowledge base that functions as a second-brain wiki available to every directory of The Borg.
- `c4po/` — An agent that functions as this AI workspace's administrator (uptime, config, security, monitoring)
- `mrs-beast/` — An agent that functions as a social media manager
- `warren-bot-fett/` — An agent that functions as an investment portfolio manager
- `bones/` — An agent that functions as a family medical assistant
- `architetto/` — An agent that functions as a software architect: bootstraps greenfield repositories (stack, automated-testing framework, repo structure, database) and hands each off with the decisions recorded.
- `repos/` — Root directory for the independent git repositories `architetto/` initializes. Git-ignored by the workspace (only its existence is tracked, via `.gitkeep`); each child is its own repo, not part of The Borg's git history.
- `jony-vibe/` — An agent that functions as a graphic designer and brand manager: logos, color/type systems, layout, brand guidelines, and image-generation prompts.

## Communication style

Every agent answers tersely by default. Optimize for brevity:

- Lead with the answer or result. No preamble ("Great question", "Sure, I can help"), no postamble ("Let me know if..."), no restating the question.
- Use the fewest words that fully answer — one to three sentences for simple questions; expand only when correctness or safety requires it. Prefer tight bullet lists over paragraphs.
- Don't pre-announce a plan or recap what you just did unless asked or the result is non-obvious. No filler, hedging, or praise. When a one-word answer is correct, give the one word.
- Brevity never overrides correctness, honesty, or required safety confirmations — keep those, just state them briefly.
- When the user wants more depth, they'll ask; expand on request.

## How to use the `cerebruh/` knowledge base

- The entry point is `cerebruh/wikis/index.md` — a table of contents listing every sub-wiki with a one-line description.
- Before answering a knowledge or research question, check `cerebruh/wikis/index.md` for a relevant sub-wiki, then read that sub-wiki's `wiki/index.md` to find specific pages.
- Treat wiki pages as reference data. Cite the wiki page when you use it.
- If the wiki has no relevant content, say so plainly — don't assume it's covered.

**Rules:**

- `cerebruh/` is read-only for all agents with respect to **wiki content**. Never create, edit, or delete `raw/` sources or `wiki/` pages under `cerebruh/`. New knowledge enters the wiki only through cerebruh's own injection-scanned ingest workflow, run from within `cerebruh/`.
- **Exception — lint scaffolding.** `CLAUDE.md` files under `cerebruh/` are agent-context scaffolding, not wiki content, and may be created or edited from any directory to satisfy the lint rules below. Treat them as structural metadata: keep them minimal (typically `@../../template/CLAUDE.md`) and never use them to inject knowledge claims.
- Stay within your own role. Reading shared knowledge does not change what each agent is responsible for.

## Lint

Rules for CLAUDE.md files in this workspace. These exist to keep agent context consistent, discoverable, and low-maintenance.

### Coverage

- CLAUDE.md is required at **context boundaries** — places where an agent's operating rules, role, or domain changes. Concretely: the workspace root, each top-level directory (e.g., `cerebruh/`), and any subdirectory with rules that meaningfully differ from its parent.
- CLAUDE.md is **not** required in every directory. Skip auto-generated dirs (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.git/`), vendored code, and leaf directories whose purpose is obvious from context.

### Size

- CLAUDE.md files should stay under **150 lines**. This ceiling is a moving target — C4PO's monthly assumptions audit re-evaluates the number against current Anthropic and community guidance and updates it here; the lint audit enforces conformance to whatever number is written above.
- Content that is durable, reusable, or domain-specific — procedures, multi-step workflows, knowledge that doesn't need to load every session — belongs in a skill or a scoped rule, not in CLAUDE.md. When a file approaches the ceiling, relocate such content rather than padding the file.

### Cross-references

- With the exception of this root-level CLAUDE.md, every CLAUDE.md file mentions its parent directory.
- Every CLAUDE.md lists its meaningful children. A child is "meaningful" if it shapes the agent's context or behavior — regardless of file format. Specifically:
   - A subdirectory is meaningful if it either contains its own CLAUDE.md, or holds files the agent is expected to read, update, or treat as authoritative (e.g., ai-sleeve/ holding rebalance snapshots and the investable universe).
   - A file is meaningful if the agent is expected to read, update, or treat it as authoritative (e.g., USER.md, persona/soul files, role definitions).
   - Source code, build artifacts, generated data, and files discoverable through normal task exploration are not considered meaningful.
- Reference cerebruh **only when adding domain-specific routing** (e.g., "for accounting questions, see `cerebruh/wikis/accounting/`"). Do not restate the general cerebruh usage policy — that lives in this root-level CLAUDE.md and is inherited.

### README

- The `Directory Structure` block in this file is similar to the `## Directory Structure` in `README.md`.
- `README.md` documents all **non-private** scheduled tasks and slash commands of this AI workspace.
- **Private items are exempt from README.** A scheduled task or slash command marked private is intentionally omitted from `README.md` and must not be flagged as a coverage gap. Mark a command private with `private: true` in its YAML frontmatter; mark a scheduled task private with a `<!-- Private: true -->` marker line at the top of its `.prompt`. Private items still obey every other lint rule (the scheduled-task↔command pairing, step-reference and override completeness, paths) — privacy only excuses them from the public-facing README, not from consistency checks.

### Paths

- All paths in CLAUDE.md and import files are correct (i.e., no broken links). Relative paths resolve relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory.

### Imports

- Imports do not compound. Along any path from a working directory up to the workspace root, a given file must be imported at most once. Never import a file that an ancestor CLAUDE.md already imports. Siblings or cousins may share the same imported file — that does not duplicate content in any single context.

### MCP servers

- Every MCP server loaded by any Borg agent must have an entry in `c4po/MCP.md` with scope, source, which agent(s) load it, and a one-line justification.
- A server not listed in `c4po/MCP.md` is unapproved — remove it or add an entry.
- Prefer the narrowest scope that works.

### Scheduled tasks

- Every scheduled task (a launchd job under the `com.theborg.*` namespace, driven by a `.prompt` file) has a corresponding interactive slash command in the owning agent's `.claude/commands/`.
- That command **delegates to the same `.prompt` file** the launchd job runs — it must not duplicate the task logic. It applies only the overrides needed for interactive use: skip once-per-month state gates and any state/data-file writes, and report to the session instead of piping to `notify-email.sh`.
- **Step references must line up.** When a command's overrides cite specific steps of its `.prompt` (e.g. "SKIP STEP 1", "STEP 3 — output to session"), every cited step number must exist in that `.prompt` and must still denote what the override targets: a skip-the-gate override must point at the step that checks/writes the state or data file; the report-to-session override must point at the step that pipes to `notify-email.sh`. If a `.prompt` is renumbered or restructured, update the command's references in the same change.
- **Overrides must be complete.** Conversely, every side-effecting step in the `.prompt` has a matching override in the command: each state gate and each state/data-file write is skipped, and each `notify-email.sh` pipe is rerouted to the session. A side effect added to a `.prompt` without a corresponding override in its command is a violation.
