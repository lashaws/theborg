#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nightly-leak-scan.sh — deep leak scan of the whole wiki using the sanitizer's
# 5-tier scanner (scripts/scan-wiki-leaks.py) as the oracle.
#
# The scanner's DEFINITE tier has known, curator-triaged false positives
# (2026-06-11 triage: Luhn-passing date+timestamp filenames read as credit
# cards; Epic registry IDs shaped like SSNs; provider office phones kept by
# policy; PATIENT-001's own codename digits as "account"). Those live in a
# baseline file; the gate trips only on NEW or INCREASED findings per
# file+class — a real leak in an already-listed file raises its count and
# still trips.
#
# Usage:
#   nightly-leak-scan.sh                    scheduled / manual scan
#   nightly-leak-scan.sh --accept-baseline  after curator triage of new
#       findings: bless the most recent run's DEFINITE set as the new baseline
#
# Writes .claude/logs/leak-scan-status, consumed by vps-mirror-sync.sh
# (fail-closed gate) and harness-health.sh:
#     clean <ISO timestamp>      — no DEFINITE findings beyond the baseline
#     DEFINITE <ISO timestamp>   — new leak-class findings; mirror gates shut
#
# Scheduled by com.life-wiki.scan at 02:30 — deliberately BEFORE gbrain dream
# (03:15) and the mirror push (07:00), so a leak is caught before the wiki's
# only external surface updates. Scanner output is digit-masked (safe to log).
