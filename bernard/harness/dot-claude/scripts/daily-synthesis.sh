# Scheduled DAILY by com.life-wiki.synthesis (06:00 — after dream 03:15 and
# leak scan 02:30). Cheap on quiet days: a bash snapshot gate (git HEAD +
# working-tree state of wikis/) exits before invoking Claude when nothing
# changed since the last completed pass. The pass itself runs an on-demand
# mirror sync, so results reach Bernard same-day regardless of the 07:00 cron.
# Manual run: bash .claude/scripts/daily-synthesis.sh
#
# Runs structural lint before the pass; skips (and notifies) on critical
# issues so synthesis never builds on a structurally broken graph.

SYNTH_PROMPT="Execute the synthesis-pass workflow documented in \
.claude/skills/synthesis-pass/SKILL.md, following every step in order. \
Read AGENT-HANDOFF.md first. Determine the window from the latest dated entry \
in the Synthesis Log section of wikis/health/wiki/holistic-health-synthesis.md \
(fallback 2026-06-09). Build the delta from git log + sources.md, pull graph \
context via gbrain graph-query/orphans and .claude/scripts/wiki-query, then \
mine each substantive new fact: pattern updates, contradictions (per \
.claude/skills/contradiction-review/SKILL.md — preserve, never resolve), and new \
multi-source chains. Append a dated entry to the Synthesis Log (append-only), \
update compiled patterns in place only when their status genuinely changes, \
cross-link entity pages both directions. If the delta contains no substantive \
new facts (mechanical changes only), append a one-line no-delta entry and \
stop. Then reindex GBrain (import --no-embed, embed --stale, extract links \
--source db) and run bash .claude/scripts/vps-mirror-sync.sh. Update \
AGENT-HANDOFF.md. Never recommend medication changes, doses, or diagnoses; \
cite every health claim with a wikilink; mark uncited inference as Hypothesis. \
Never edit raw/ or ingest/ files. Report a summary when done."
